# ☕ GupShup & Coffee – Where Every Sip Sparks a Story

Welcome to **GupShup & Coffee**, a cozy, beautifully designed café website that celebrates Indian chai, artisanal coffee, and heartfelt conversations. This is a **frontend-only project** (for now), built with love and clean ReactJS practices. Future updates will include backend integration with MongoDB, user/admin login, and payment gateway functionality.
